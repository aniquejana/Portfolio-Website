        <p style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Anique Jana</strong> is a resourceful and dedicated college student pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Technology</strong> in Computer Science and Engineering at Techno International Newtown. With a strong academic record, Anique's current SGPA stands at an impressive 9.221. Passionate about new computer technology and research-oriented work, Anique is committed to exploring the frontiers of the digital world.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anique's educational journey began at Panchberia Ramchandra Smriti Siksha Mandir(H.S), where academic excellence was a consistent theme. In the West Bengal Board of Higher Examination, Anique achieved an outstanding percentage of 93.00 during the academic year 2019-2020. Anique's dedication to learning was evident during the West Bengal Madhyamik Examination, where a remarkable percentage of 92.43 was achieved in a diverse range of subjects including Bengali, English, Physical Science, Life Science, Mathematics, History, and Geography.
            
            <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fueling Anique's passion for computer science and technology, internships played a pivotal role in expanding knowledge and skills. Anique embarked on a Data Science and Machine Learning Internship at TwoTwaits, focusing on data collection through web scraping techniques from platforms like Netflix. This experience involved extracting valuable information using tools like Beautiful Soup (BS4). Additionally, Anique ventured into the realm of sales and business development as a Sales Business Development Intern at Champion Learns. This role provided insights into effective product selling techniques, digital marketing, and network marketing strategies.
            
            <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anique's skills encompass a wide array of areas including programming languages such as C/C++ and Python, computer networking, object-oriented programming (OOP), Microsoft Word proficiency, data structures and algorithms (DSA), machine learning (ML), NetBeans, Android Studio, operating systems, and software engineering.
            
            <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anique's commitment to innovative projects is evident through notable contributions. A prominent project titled "An Ensemble Learning-Based DDoS Attack Detection Considering the Impact of ICA" was presented at the 2023 14th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT 2022) at IEEE, IIT Delhi. This project demonstrates Anique's collaboration and problem-solving skills. Another substantial achievement involves leading a team in developing a Hospital Management System using Java and XML on the Android Studio IDE. This project aimed to streamline online doctor bookings, prescription retrieval, and lab testing.
            
            <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a collaborative effort, Anique participated in the "Scantist" project during the Smart India Hackathon. This venture involved designing an online ticket booking system for heritage sites and cultural destinations, integrating Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an efficient QR-based entry system.
